=head1 NAME

catalyst-fatstart.pl - catalyst starter that tries to know better than
you

=head1 VERSION

This app and its module is version 0.9.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

catalyst-fatstart.pl -n MyCatApp [options]

 Options:
  --TT         Adds a C::View::TT component, defaults to HTML.pm
  --JSON       Adds a C::View::JSON component, defaults to JSON.pm
  --dsn        Specify a dsn for a model
  --model      Set model name. Default: name . "DB"
  --schema     Schema class. Default: name . "::Schema"
  a lot more, see --usage, --man, --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script starts a new catalyst project. It uses catalyst.pl that
comes with Catalyst::Runtime to do the dirty work.

Furthermore it optionally does zero or more of the following:

=over

=item *

Adds a TT view, see --TT. Also see --views which is short for
doing both TT and JSON.

=item *

Adds a JSON view, see --JSON

=item *

Adds a HTML5 template. Currently a twitter bootstrap template from
initializr.com.

=item *

Adds a model with a schema. If not spesified, they get default
names. Note:

=over

=item ·

Only ever does DBIC::Schema models. Do not use this if you use
other types of models.

=item ·

Always uses create=static to create schema files. Do not create a
model with this tool if you don't mean to create schema files. Also
requires a working db connection somewhere that contains at least one
sql schema.

=back

=back

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item -[-]n[ame] [=] <name>

Name of catalyst app, what you would otherwise specify like this:
catalyst.pl name

=for Euclid:
    name.type: str

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -[-]TT [=] [<HTML>]

Add a Catalyst::View::TT view, defaults to YourApp::View::HTML.

In addition to defaults created with Catalyst::Helper it will also be
configured with:

    TEMPLATE_EXTENSION => 'tt2',
    WRAPPER => 'wrapper.tt2',

The ::HTML part of the package name can be changed by giving the
argument a value, ie --TT MyView would create YourApp::View::MyView
instead.

The 'YourApp::View::' part of the package name is automatic and
unchangable here.

Also touches root/index.tt2 and root/wrapper.tt2. If wrapper.tt2 is
empty it inserts [% content %] in it.

=for Euclid:
    HTML.opt_default: "HTML"

=item -[-]JSON [=] [<JSON>]

Add a Catalyst::View::JSON view, defaults to YourApp::View::JSON. The
same rules and options applies as to --TT

In addition to any defaults set by Catalyst::Helper, it also
configures:

    export_stash => [ qw(json) ],

This means that only data in $c->stash->{json} will be included in
output. Remove this config line afterwards if you do not want it.

=for Euclid:
    JSON.opt_default: "JSON"

=item -[-]html5 | -[-]h5

Set up a html5 template with twitter bootstrap and jquery downloaded
from http://www.initializr.com.

When downloaded it fills root/wrapper.tt2 with content from the
index.html from initializr.com and inserts [% content %] and puts
sample input in root/index.tt2.

=item -[-]views

Short hand for saying --TT and --JSON with default names

=item -[-]model [=] [<modelname>]

Package name to use for your model. If modelname not specified,
defaults to the catalyst name and "DB", ie "CatNameDB"

You can also put a dsn in here. It will then be reassigned to the
--dsn option, and the default model name will be used.

Note, *only* does DBIC::Schema. Do not use any of the model logic if
you do not want a DBIC::Schema model.

=for Euclid:
  modelname.opt_default: "AppNameDB"

=item -[-]schema [=] <SchemaClass>

The name of the schema class to go with the dbic model. Defaults to
CatName::Schema, where CatName is the name of the catalyst app.

=item -[-]dsn [=] <dsn>

A DSN to set up a db connection for one model in your catalyst app.

If user and pass are not specified it will try the dsn without
credentials. Expects connection to succeed.

B<Important>: Will set --model and --schema with default names unless
they are also specified. Default names currently are CatNameDB and
CatName::Schema.

=item -[-][no]dsnfix

Checks and corrects the dsn input

Fixes case of known drivers, adds missing leading dbi:, tries to
verify and correct sqlite file paths, checks that hostnames can be resolved

=for Euclid:
    false: --nodsnfix

=item -[-][no]pgpass

If set, will look in ~/.pgpass to complete dbi information.

Will currently only suplement the dsn if it finds a matching database
name.

It will set --dbuser and --dbpass as spropriate unless they are set.

=for Euclid:
    false: --nopgpass

=item -[-]dbuser [=] <dbuser>

Username for the db connection.

=item -[-]dbpass [=] <dbpass>

Db for the db connection.

=item -[-]pgpass

Causes it to look through $HOME/.pgpass for credentials for postgresql
connections.

=item -[-][no]test

Run all tests when done

=for Euclid:
    false: --notest

=item -[-]debug | -d

Set debug level for logging.

Currently there is no other interface to log level.

=item --verbose

Run more verbosely - shows stdout on all system calls made. Stderr is
always shown.

=item --version | -V

Prints version

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or

    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.

    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.
