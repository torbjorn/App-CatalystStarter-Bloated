App-CatalystStarter-Bloated version 0.0.1

Provides catalyst-fatstart.pl. It creates a new catalyst application
for you using previously installed catalyst.pl.

In addition to that it also sets up commonly used components such as:

* A TT view with wrapper
* A JSON view
* A Model with an (optionally tested working) db connection
* Sets up a cached template from http://www.initializr.com as the wrapper.

It tries to be as helpful as possible, running interactively and
offering meaningful tab completions.

Future Enhancements:

* Take DBIx::Class::Schema::Config into account when looking up
  credentials

* Do on the fly downloads from www.initializr.com

Much of the functionality deserves its own namespace and will get
forked off in the future. Most likely the following:

* A dsn parser
* initializr.com related
* pgpass parsing
