App-CatalystStarter-Bloated version 0.0.1

Provides catalyst-fatstart.pl. It creates a new catalyst application
for you using previously installed catalyst.pl.

In addition to that it also sets up commonly used components such as:

* A TT view with wrapper
* A JSON view
* A Model with an (optionally tested working) db connection
* Sets up a cached template from http://www.initializr.com as the wrapper.
* More as the need arises.

It tries to be as helpful as possible, running interactively and
offering meaningful tab completions.
